# interEHDFoam
Electrohydrodynamics solver based on OpenFOAM 4.1 two-phase flow solver interFoam

Run installer (./installer) to compile the solver. Alternatively, you may fist run "wmake libso" in immiscibleIncompressibleTwoPhaseEHDMixture folder and then run "wmake" in interEHDFoam folder.

Deformation of a droplet in uniform electric field is included as an example. Run the script (./Scrun) in testcase folder.
